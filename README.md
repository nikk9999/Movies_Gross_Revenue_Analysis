# Movies_Gross_Revenue_Analysis
To investigate the relationship between the movie descriptors and the box office success of movies,
as represented by the variable Gross. This task is extremely important as it can help a studio decide which
titles to fund for production, how much to bid on produced movies, when to release a title, how much to
invest in marketing and PR, etc. This information is most useful before a title is released, but it is still very
valuable after the movie is already released to the public (for example it can affect additional marketing
spend or how much a studio should negotiate with on-demand streaming companies for Ã¢ second window
streaming rights).Also to build a linear regression model that can predict the Gross revenue earned by a
movie based on other variables.
